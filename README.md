## NeuroMorpho.Org Showcase

A set of example reconstructed neuronal morphologies taken from [NeuroMorpho.Org](http://NeuroMorpho.Org) in NeuroML format.

Some of these are available in [NeuroML v1 format](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/NeuroMorpho/tree/master/NeuroML), but **the main target version of NeuroML is [NeuroML v2.0](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/NeuroMorpho/tree/master/NeuroML2)**. There are some examples of the original data in [SWC format](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/NeuroMorpho/tree/master/SWC).

Cells converted to NeuroML v2.0 can be visualised on Open Source Brain, e.g. this monkey pyramidal cell (left) or blowfly visual neuron (right):

Note: converting NeuroMorpho.Org morphologies to NeuroML is facilitated by the Cvapp 3D Neuron viewer. This can be launched from the individual neuron pages on NeuroMorpho.Org (e.g. [here](http://neuromorpho.org/neuron_info.jsp?neuron_name=cnic_004)) or run standalone using the code [here](https://github.com/pgleeson/Cvapp-NeuroMorpho.org).

More details on how to export NeuroML 2 cells from NeuroMorpho.Org and put them on OSB for visualisation, can be found in [this tutorial](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/NeuroinformaticsTutorial/blob/master/Exercises/Exercise1_NeuroMorpho_to_OSB.md).
